      <h2>🌸 About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey love, I’m Ayaati. I’m 19 — a writer, a singer, a gym girl, and most importantly, a girl who chose to rewrite her story when life gave her every reason not to.

I’ve been through more than most people would guess at first glance — bullying that made me shrink into silence, heartbreak that left me empty, harassment that made me fear being seen. I’ve lived in a home that didn’t always feel like home. I’ve been in friend groups where I felt like a stranger. I’ve faced rejection, betrayal, and moments where my confidence didn’t just crack — it disappeared.

There was a time I couldn’t even look in the mirror. I was overweight, struggling with acne, and completely disconnected from myself. But what hurt more than any of that was the way I had stopped believing I deserved more.

But something inside me — even the smallest flicker — refused to give up.

I started showing up for myself. Quietly, gently. Through poetry. Through the gym. Through tears I never told anyone about. I worked on myself every day, not for validation — but to feel whole again. And slowly, I began to glow — not just outside, but deep within.

Now, I stand here healed. Clear-skinned. Fit. Confident. I love who I see in the mirror, but even more, I love who I’ve become. People tell me my energy feels magnetic, even intimidating — but I know it’s just the peace I built inside myself radiating out.

This blog — *The Self Edit* — is my way of reaching back with open arms. To the version of me who was still hurting. And to *you*, if you’re still finding your way.

You don’t need to be perfect to start healing. You just need to start. I’m living proof that it’s possible to turn your pain into power — and I’m here to show you how.

Let me help you.

Let me guide you into your glow-up.

Through every blog, every word, I’ll remind you: you’re not too much, you’re not too broken, and you’re not behind.</p>
