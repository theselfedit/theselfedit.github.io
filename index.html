    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       Hey love, I’m Ayaati. I’m 19 — a writer, a singer, a gym girl, and most importantly, a girl who chose to rewrite her story when life gave her every reason not to.

I’ve been through more than most people would guess at first glance — bullying that made me shrink into silence, heartbreak that left me empty, harassment that made me fear being seen. I’ve lived in a home that didn’t always feel like home. I’ve been in friend groups where I felt like a stranger. I’ve faced rejection, betrayal, and moments where my confidence didn’t just crack — it disappeared.

There was a time I couldn’t even look in the mirror. I was overweight, struggling with acne, and completely disconnected from myself. But what hurt more than any of that was the way I had stopped believing I deserved more.

But something inside me — even the smallest flicker — refused to give up.

I started showing up for myself. Quietly, gently. Through poetry. Through the gym. Through tears I never told anyone about. I worked on myself every day, not for validation — but to feel whole again. And slowly, I began to glow — not just outside, but deep within.

Now, I stand here healed. Clear-skinned. Fit. Confident. I love who I see in the mirror, but even more, I love who I’ve become. People tell me my energy feels magnetic, even intimidating — but I know it’s just the peace I built inside myself radiating out.

This blog — The Self Edit — is my way of reaching back with open arms. To the version of me who was still hurting. And to you, if you’re still finding your way.

You don’t need to be perfect to start healing. You just need to start. I’m living proof that it’s possible to turn your pain into power — and I’m here to show you how.

Let me help you.
Let me guide you into your glow-up.
Through every blog, every word, I’ll remind you: you’re not too much, you’re not too broken, and you’re not behind.
