      <h2>🌸 About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Ayaati. I'm 19 years old, and I’m passionate about writing, singing, and working out. I’ve been through a lot in life—bullying, heartbreak, toxic environments, and struggles that felt like they would never end. But through it all, I’ve grown, healed, and transformed into the confident, empowered woman I am today.</p>
      <p>I used to struggle with my confidence, facing issues with weight, acne, and feeling unworthy. But today, I am fit, with clearer skin, and a newfound love for who I am. I’ve learned to embrace my power, my beauty, and my unique journey. People often say I have a magnetic aura, and opportunities just seem to fall into my lap. I never face rejection anymore, and I want to help you feel the same way—confident, powerful, and unapologetically you.</p>
      <p>Let me share everything I've learned with you through my blog and help you start your own glow-up journey.</p>
